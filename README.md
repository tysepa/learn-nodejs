INTRODUCTION TO NODE JS 
Why Learn Node.js?
JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. The powerful Node.js runtime environment has been ranked 
the technology most commonly used by professional developers. Node.js is an event-driven JavaScript runtime. Node has 
myriad potential uses for JavaScript development including being a great environment for building efficient network applications.

Take-Away Skills
This course is a great introduction to the concepts of server-side web development. You’ll learn the different parts that 
make up the back-end of a website or web application, and you’ll gain familiarity with the Node.js runtime environment. 
After this course, you’ll be set up to explore popular Node frameworks like Express.js to build powerful applications.

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O 
primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using
non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking 
the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing
thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write
the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.
